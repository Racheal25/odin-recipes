<h2>Description</h2>
Afang  soup is fast climbing the top of the list of popular Nigerian soup. If you are interested in exploring Nigerian foods, this delicious soup would definitely spur your interest in Nigerian foods. This delicious soup is native to the Efiks, the major occupant of (Cross River & Akwa Ibom State).

Over the last few months I have focused on Efik delicacies, afang sits right on top of the list and today we are going to learn how to make this soup and other delicious Efik/Calabar foods.

Apart from this soup, they also have Edikang-Ikong, atama, nsala, and a few other delicious  soups.
