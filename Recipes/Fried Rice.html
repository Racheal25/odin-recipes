<h2>Description</h2>
Fried rice is one of the most widely eaten Nigerian food; almost every Nigerian accepts it both at home and in Diaspora. I will show you how I make it. I make this once every month and my family always looks forward to it. Most often I serve with fried chicken, you can  grill your chicken instead.

I am sure I detailed this recipe enough and would make the entire process a cakewalk.

Here is the complete ingredient for making this delicious Nigerian food.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 cups of rice.</li>
    <li>5 cups of sliced Cabbage.</li>
    <li>2 cups of sliced Carrot.</li>
    <li>2 cups of sliced Green beans.</li>
    <li>Half cup of peas.</li>
    <li>1 cup of sliced Green pepper.</li>
    <li>Cow Liver {300g}.</li>
    <li>2kg of Chicken.</li>
    <li> Vegetable oil (200ml).</li>
    <li>1 cup of sliced Onions.</li>
    <li>Curry powder (coloring spice) {2 Tablespoons}.</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Parboil chicken and liver (both together) with all the spices (a teaspoon of salt, half cup of sliced onions, a teaspoon of thyme spice, a teaspoon of curry, two seasoning cubes teaspoon each of powdered ginger and garlic).</li> 
    <li>Allow the meat to cook for ten to fifteen minutes, taste for salt, then pick out and deep-fry. Be sure to reserve the stock (meat water)</li> 
    <li>Chop the cabbage, green beans, carrot, liver and set aside in a wide tray.</li> 
    <li>Parboil the 4 cups of rice also and cook with half of the meat stock (water from the meat) and two cups of water, cook until it is about 70% done.</li> 
    <li>Set your cooking pot on heat, allow drying, then pour in about 200ml of vegetable oil.
        Note: It is better to continue with the same oil you used while frying the meat (that is only if you fried the meats), you can reduce it to 200ml.</li> 
    <li>Allow heating, then add the sliced onions, stir for 1-2 minutes.</li> 
    <li>Then add the chopped carrot and green beans, any of these two can actually go first.</li> 
    <li>Add the chopped liver and sweet corn, stir.</li> 
    <li>Meat stock (water from the meat) should follow, add ground pepper (optional), add a teaspoon of salt and, add 1 seasoning cube then stir and taste, you may add more salt.</li> 
    <li>Add the green peas.</li>
    <li>Stir for 1-2 minutes then add cabbage and the  curry powder (Curry is a yellowish spice that actually adds the yellowish color to fried rice, add and stir till you are satisfied with the color). You would have a yellowish mixture that would often taste overly spiced, donâ€™t worry the rice would balance the taste.</li>
    <li>If you are satisfied with the taste, then add the green pepper, stir.</li>
    <li>Add the almost-done white rice and stir. Stir all together, cover your pot and allow to simmer for 5-7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Serve with the fried or fried  meat (chicken).</li>
</ol>
